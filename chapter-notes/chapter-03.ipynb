    "The methodology for finding a value for a key-value pair is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{mid } = \\lfloor (\\textrm{low } + \\textrm{ high}/2 \\rfloor)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main parameters of low and high dictate how the search will proceed. Initially, low = 1 and high = n. There exists three cases for analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. if k = key(mid), then the desired item is found and the search terminates\n",
    "2. if k < key(mid), then the first have of the vector (indices low to mid - 1) is recursively searched\n",
    "3. if k > key(mid), the range of indices from mid + 1 to high is recursively searched\n",
    "\n",
    "The following method searches for item k on an n-item sorted array A, indexed from 1 to n: \n",

    "\n",
    "For statically sizes arrays, this algorithm operates in $O(logn)$ time as $m = \\lfloor logn \\rfloor + 1$. For dynamically sized arrays where insertions and deletions are performed, these updates take $O(n)$ time. The space requirement of this algorithm is $\\Theta(n)$. The recurrence relation of the recursive binary search algorithm is as follows: \n",

    "### Binary Search Trees (BSTs)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binary search tree**: a binary tree in which every node stores a key-value pair (k,e) such that keys stored at nodes in the left subtree are less than or equal to k, while keys stored at nodes in the right subtree are greater than or equal to k\n",
    "\n",
    "The following algorithm performs a search of binary trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "![bst-search](./res/03-bst-search.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "While technically this algorithm runs in $O(h)$ time, with h being the height of the tree, it is very probable that it will actually be bounded by $O(logn)$ as h is rarely as large as n. It has the following recurrence relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![bst-recurrence](./res/03-bst-recurrence.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following algorithm inserts data into a BST in $O(h)$ time in the worst case and $O(logn)$ time in the best case: \n",
    "\n",
    "![bst-insert](./res/03-bst-insert.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "When deleting from BSTs, the tree must be re-balanced to ensure that there are no holes in it. Removal takes $O(n)$ in the worse case and $O(logn)$ in the best case\n",
    "\n",
    "## Range Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Range query**: operation that returns all elements in the tree that have a key k such that $k_1 \\leq k \\leq k_2$. This algorithm operates on three cases within the tree: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. $key(v) < k_1$: recursively search the right child of v\n",
    "2. $k_1 \\leq key(v) \\leq k_2$: report element(v) and recursively search both children of v\n",
    "3. $key(v) > k_2$: recursively search the left child of v\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm runs in $O(h+s)$ time and is implemented in the following manner: \n",
    "\n",
    "![range-query](./res/03-range-query.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Index-based Searching\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm enables the quick return of an item with i-th smallest key in a BST. It is implemented by adding a new field to each node, $n_v$, which tracks the number of items stored in the subtree that is rooted at that node. This algorithm is represented by the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "![index-search](./res/03-index-search.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the insertion and deletion case, this additional work to update $n_v$ takes $O(h)$ time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Randomly Constructed Search Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "If only add operations occur in a randomly constructed BST, then the tree's height is $O(logn)$\n",
    "\n",
    "If random additions and deletions in a BST occur, then the tree's height is $O(n^{1/2})$\n"
