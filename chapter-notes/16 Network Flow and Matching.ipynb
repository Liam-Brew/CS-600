    "# Chapter 16: Network Flow and Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maximum flow**: given a weighted directed graph, find a way of transporting the maximum amount of the given commodity from some vertex s, called the source, to some vertex t, called the sink. The value of each edge is represented by its weight\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flow Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "A flow network N consists of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- connected directed graph G with nonnegative integer weights on the edges, where the weight of an edge e is called the **capacity** c(e) of e \n",
    "- two distinguished vertices, the **source** (s) and **sink** (t), such that s has no incoming edges and t has no outgoing edges\n",
    "\n",
    "A flow for network N is an assignment of an integer value f(e) to each edge e of G that satisfies the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **capacity rule**: $0 \\leq f(e) \\leq c(e)\n",
    "- **conservation rule**: $\\sum_{e \\in E^-(v)}f(e) = \\sum_{e \\in E^+(v)}f(e)$. $E^-(v)$ and $E^+(v)$ denote incoming and outgoing edges, respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantity f(e) is called the **flow** of an edge. A **maximal flow** network is a flow with the largest value over all flows for N\n",
    "\n",
    "A **cut** is a partition $x = (V_s,V_t)$ of the vertices of N such that $s \\in V_s$ and $t \\in V_t$. An edge with an origin in $V_s$ and a destination in $V_t$ is a **forward edge**, while the opposite is said to be a **backward edge**. The **flow across cut x**, denoted f(x), is the sum of the flows of forward edges minus those of backward edges\n",
    "\n",
    "For any cut x in a flow network, the value of f does not exceed the capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "An **augmenting path** for flow f is a path $\\pi$ from s to t that, for each edge e in $\\pi$:\n",
    "\n",
    "- f(e) < c(e) if e is a forward edge\n",
    "- f(e) > 0 if e is a backward edge\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of a maximum flow is equal to the capacity of a **minimum cut**, which is a cut with a minimum capacity taken all other cuts of N\n",
    "\n",
    "## Maximum Flow Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm incrementally increases the value of a flow in stages, where at each stage some amount of flow is pushed along an augmenting path from the source to the sink:\n",
    "\n",
    "![ford-fulkerson](./res/16-ford-fulkerson.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm runs in $O(|f^*|m)$ time, where m is the number of edges and $f^*$ is a maximum flow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edmonds-Karp Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is a modification of the Ford-Fulkerson one. At each iteration, an augmenting path with the smallest number of edges is chosen in $O(m)$ time using a breadth-first-search traversal. This algorithm runs in $O(nm^2)$ time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Maximum Bipartite Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "A connected undirected graph G exists with the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- vertices of G are partitioned into two sets, X and Y\n",
    "- every edge of G has one endpoint in X and the other in Y\n",
    "\n",
    "A **matching** in G is a set of edges that have no endpoints in common. The maximum bipartite matching problem is to find a matching with the greatest number of edges (overall matchings)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Baseball Elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "Determines whether it is possible for team i to finish the season in first place, given the games it has already won and the games it has left to play\n",
    "\n",
    "For a set of n teams, this problem may be solved using a single maximum flow problem on a network with at most $O(n^2)$ vertices and edges\n",
    "\n",
    "## Minimum-cost Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "A second integer weight w(e) is added for each edge, representing that edge's **cost**. The cost of a flow f is described as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w(f) = \\sum_{e \\in E} w(e)f(e)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem consists of finding a maximum flow that has the lowest cost over all maximum flows\n",
    "\n",
    "An **augmenting cycle** is an augmenting path whose first and last vertices are the same\n",
    "\n",
    "Let x be an augmenting cycle for flow f in network N. There exists a flow f' for N of value $|f'| = |f|$ and cost $w(f') = w(f) + w(x)\\Delta_f(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow f has a minimum cost among all flows of value |f| if and only if there is no augmenting cycle of negative cost with respect to f\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an n-vertex flow network N with costs associated with its m edges, together with a maximum flow f*, a maximum flow of minimum cost may be computed in $O(w*nm)$ time, where w* is the total cost of f*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let f be a minimum-cost flow, and let f' be the flow obtained by augmenting f along an augmenting path $\\pi$ of minimum cost. Flow f' is a minimum-cost flow\n",
    "\n",
    "For each edge (u,v) of residual network $R_g$ $w'(u,v) \\geq 0$\n",
