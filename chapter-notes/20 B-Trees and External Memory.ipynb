    "# Chapter 20: B-Trees and External Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CPU registers**: very fast access, but relatively few locations\n",
    "- **cache memory**: longer access times, but more exists\n",
    "- **random access memory/internal memory**: slower access than cache with more existing\n",
    "- **external memory**: slowest access with largest space\n",
    "\n",
    "## External Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms are not designed with memory hierarchy in mind. It is assumed that OS designers that developed general mechanisms for fast memory access, known as **locality of reference** properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **temporal locality**: if a program accesses a certain memory location, then it is likely to access this location again in the near future \n",
    "- **spatial locality**: if a program accesses a certain memory location, then it is likely to access other locations that are near this one\n",
    "\n",
    "These localities have in turn given rise to two computer memory systems: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **virtual memory**: provides an address space as large as the capacity of the secondary-level memory and transfers into primary-level memory when addressed. Not limited to the constraint of internal memory size. The concept of bringing data into primary memory is known as **caching**\n",
    "- **blocking**: if data stored at a secondary-level memory location l is accessed, then bring into primary-level memory a large block of contiguous locations that include the location l. Blocks of memory are known as **pages**\n",

    "## (2,4) Trees and B-Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-way search tree**: ordered tree T that has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- each internal node of T has at least two children. That is, each internal node is a d-node where $d \\geq 2$\n",
    "- each internal node of T stores a collection of items of the form (k,x)\n",
    "- each d-node v of T with children $v_1,...,v_d$ stores d-1 items $(k_1,x_1),...,(k_{d-1},x_{d-1})$\n",
    "- $k_0 = -\\infty$ and $k_d = +\\infty$. For each item (k,x) stored at a node in the subtree of v, rooted at $v_i$, i = 1, ..., d we have $k_{i-1} \\leq k \\leq k_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "A multi-way search tree storing n items has n+1 external nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "The running time for performing a search is $O(h)$. The space requirement for T is $O(n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### (2,4) Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Balance in (2,4) trees can be maintained by two properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **size property**: every node has at most 4 children\n",
    "- **depth property**: all the external nodes have the same depth\n",
    "\n",
    "The height of a (2,4) tree storing n items is $\\Theta(logn)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The time to perform an insertion and a removal in a (2,4) tree is $O(logn)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### (a,b) Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "An (a,b) tree, where a and b are integers such that $2 \\leq a \\leq (b+1)/2$, is a multi-way search tree T with the following additional restrictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **size property**: each internal node has at least a children, unless it is the root, and has at most b children\n",
    "- **depth property**: all the external nodes have the same depth\n",
    "\n",
    "The height of an (a,b) tree storing n items is $\\Omega(logn/logb)$ and $O(logn/loga)$\n",
    "\n",
    "An (a,b) tree implements an n-item dictionary to support performing insertions and removals in $O((g(b)/log )logn)$ time, and performing find queries in $O((f(b)/loga)logn)$ time\n",
    "\n",
    "A B-tree with n items executes $O(log_Bn)$ disk transfers in a search or update operation, where B is the number of items that can fit in one block\n",
