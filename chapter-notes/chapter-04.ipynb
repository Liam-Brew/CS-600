    "# Chapter 04: Balanced Binary Search Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "BSTs support **nearest-neighbor queries**, which enables the quick return of values that are close to the specified key. To accomplish this, the height of BSTs must be limited to ensure proper running times. This is accomplished via **balancing** of the tree\n",
    "\n",
    "![tree-summary](./res/04-tree-summary.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ranks and Rotations\n",
    "\n",
    "A balanced BST is one that maintains a height of $O(logn)$\n",
    "\n",
    "A **rank** is an integer associated with each node v. It is either the height of v or a value related to the height of v. There are three **rank-balanced trees**: AVL trees, red-black trees, and weak AVL trees\n",
    "\n",
    "![trinode-restructure](./res/04-trinode-restructure.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Trees are balanced through an operation known as **rotation**. **Trinode restructuring** combines all four types of rotation into a single action, and rotates a tree while maintaining the in-order relationships of all of its nodes. This is implemented via the following algorithm: \n",
    "\n",
    "![trinode-restructuring-algo](./res/04-trinode-restructuring-algo.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "## AVL Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "**Height-balance property**: for every internal node v in T, the heights of the children of v may differ by at most 1. That is, if a node v has children x and y, then $|r(x) - r(y)| \\leq 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "![avl-summary](./res/04-avl-summary.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching in an AVL tree runs in $O(logn)$ time. An AVL tree storing n keys has a height of at most $2logn + 2$. This must be maintained for both insertions and removals:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure below, a new node for key 54 is added, which causes the tree to become unbalanced. Trinode restructuring is used to re-balance the tree. Note that one rotation (either single or double) is enough to restore the height-balance in an AVL tree after insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "![avl-insertion](./res/04-avl-insertion.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Removal\n",
    "\n",
    "If an internal node is removed and a child elevated in its place, there may result in at most one unbalanced node in the resulting tree. In the figure below, let z be the first unbalanced node encountered going upward to the root of T. Let y be the child of z with the larger height, and let x be a child of y defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- if one of the children of y is taller than the other, let x be the taller child of y\n",
    "- else let x be the child of y on the same side as y\n",
    "\n",
    "![avl-removal](./res/04-avl-removal.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "$O(logn)$ trinode restructurings are sufficient to restore the height-balance property \n",
    "\n",
    "## Red-black Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "A red-black tree is a BST with nodes colored red and black in a way that satisfies the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **external-node property**: every external node is black\n",
    "- **internal-node property**: the children of a red node are black\n",
    "- **black-depth property**: all the external nodes have the same black depth, meaning the same number of black nodes as proper ancestors\n",
    "\n",
    "![red-black-summary](./res/04-red-black-summary.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "The height of a red-black tree storing n items is $O(logn)$, and searching one takes $O(logn)$ time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rank-based Red-black Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative definition of these trees uses ranking to avoid the explicit black-depth problem. Instead, a **rank difference** exists, which is the difference between rank of node v and its parent. This ranking scheme satisfies the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **external-node property**: every external node has rank 0 and its parent, if it exists, has rank 1\n",
    "- **parent property**: the rank difference of every node, other than the root, is 0 or 1\n",
    "- **grandparent property**: any node with rank difference 0 is either a child of the root or its parent has rank difference 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the following rules governing node ranking exist: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **color-assignment rule**: if a node has a rank difference 0, then color it red; otherwise color it black \n",
    "- **rank-assignment rule**: give each black node in T a rank equal to its black height, and give each red node equal to the rank of its (black) parent\n",
    "\n",
    "![red-black-ranks](./res/04-red-black-ranks.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weak AVL Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "These trees have characteristics of both AVL and red-black trees. A rank is assigned to each node so that it's rank is less than that of its parent. The **rank difference** for v is the difference between v's rank and the rank of v's parent. An internal node is a **1,1-node** if its children each have rank difference 1. It is a **2,2-node** if its children each have rank difference 2. It is a **1,2-node** if it has one child with rank difference 1 and one with rank difference 2. The ranks assigned have the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **rank-difference property**: the rank difference of any non-root node is 1 or 2\n",
    "- **external-node property**: every external node has rank 0\n",
    "- **internal-node property**: an internal node with two external-node children cannot be a 2,2-node\n",
    "\n",
    "Every AVL tree is a weak AVL tree, and every weak AVL tree can be colored as a red-black tree. The height of a weak AVL tree is at most $2log(n+1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "If an insertion is performed at external node q, then the rank of q is **promoted** by 1. Then the following re-balancing operation takes place:\n",
    "\n",
    "- if q has a rank difference 1 after promotion, or if q is the root, then the re-balancing is complete\n",
    "- else if q has a rank difference 0 with its parent p, then the following:\n",
    "  - q's sibling has rank difference 1: promote p and replace q by p, then repeat the re-balancing operation for the new version of q\n",
    "  - q's sibling has rank-difference 2: let t denote a child of q that has rank-difference 1. By induction, a child always exists. Trinode restructuring is performed at t. Set the rank of the node replacing p to be p's old rank, and set the ranks of its children so that they have a rank difference of 1. This repairs all rule violations without creating new ones and ends the re-balancing operation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deletion\n",
    "\n",
    "A node v exists with children u and q. During the deletion, u and v are removed. If v was the root, then q is the new root. If not, then q becomes the new child of p, which was v's former parent. The following then happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. if sibling s of q has a rank difference 2 with p, then p is **demoted** by 1. If this causes a violation of the rank-difference property at p, then p is re-labeled as q and the re-balancing operation repeats\n",
    "2. else if s has a rank difference 1 with p, then there exists two sub-cases:\n",
    "   1. both children of s have rank difference 2: demote both p and s. If this creates a rank difference violation at p, we relabel p as q and repeat the re-balancing operation\n",
    "   2. node s has at least one child t with rank difference 1 (if both children hav rank-difference 1, pick the one on the same side as s): perform trinode restructuring at t. This does not create any new violations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Splay Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the previous trees, splay trees don't use explicit ranks or rules to enforce balance. They instead apply **splaying**, a move-to-root operation, after every access to keep the search tree balanced in an amortized sense. This guarantees amortized running times for insertions, deletions, and searches that are logarithmic\n",
    "\n",
    "### Splaying\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal node x is splayed by moving it to the root of the tree through a sequence of restructurings. The specific operation performed depends on the relative positions of x, its parent y, and its grandparent z (if it exists). There are three cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **zig-zig**: x and y are both left or right children. Replace z by x, making y a child of x and z a child of y, while maintaining in-order relationships \n",
    "- **zig-zag**: one of x and y is a left child and the other is a right child. Replace z by x and make y and z be the children of x, while maintaining in-order relationships\n",
    "- **zig**: x does not have a grandparent. Rotate x over y so that x's children are y and w (a former child of x), to maintain in-order relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat these restructurings at x until x becomes the root of T \n",
    "\n",
    "When to splay?:\n",
    "\n",
    "- if searching for key k and k is found at node x, splay x, or else splay the parent node at which the search terminates unsuccessfully \n",
    "- when inserting key k, splay the newly created internal node where k gets inserted \n",
    "- when deleting key k, splay the parent of the node w that gets removed (w is either the node storing k or one of its descendants)\n",
    "\n",
    "The total running time for performing m operations on a splay tree is $O(mlogn)$\n"
