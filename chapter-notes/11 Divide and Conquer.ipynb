    "**Maximum**: point (x,y) in a set where no other point, (x',y') exists such that $x \\leq x'$ and $y \\leq y'$. The **maxima** set represents the greatest of a set of points. Choosing between them depends on the desired weightings of x and y\n",

    "## Recurrences and the Master Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Divide and conquer technique**: solving a computational problem by dividing it into one or more sub-problems of smaller size, recursively solving each subproblem, and then merging the solutions to the sub-problems to produce a solution to the original problem \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of S(n) is solved by dividing it into a collection of k sub-problems S($n_1$), S($n_2$), ... , S($n_k$)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recurrence equations**: used to analyze divide and conquer run times\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterative Substitution Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the problem size n is fairly large. The general form of the recurrence relation is substituted for each occurrence of the function T on the right hand side\n",
    "\n",
    "Requires a significant amount of algebra to get equations into a form where a general pattern may be inferred\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recursion Tree Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the iterative substitution method, but instead of being an algebraic approach it is a visual one\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node v of tree R has a value of the argument n of the function T(n) associated with it. Additionally, an **overhead** is associated with each node, which is the value of the non-recursive part of the recurrence equation for v. The recurrence equation is then solved by summing the overheads associated with all the nodes of R\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guess and Test Method\n",
    "\n",
    "First, an educated guess as to what a closed-form solution of the recurrence equation is made. Then, that guess is justified via induction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Master Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "A method for solving divide and conquer recurrence relations that is quite general and does not require explicit use of induction. It is used for recurrence equations of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T(n) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l}c \\rightarrow \\textrm{ if n < d }\\\\ aT(n/b)+f(n) \\rightarrow \\textrm{ if } n \\geq d \\end{array} \\right. $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "In the above equation, $d \\geq 1$ is an integer constant, $a \\geq 1, c > 0$, and $b > 1$ are real constants, and f(n) is a function that is positive for $n \\geq d$\n",
    "\n",
    "The master theorem involves writing down the answer based on one of three cases:\n",

    "## Integer Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the product of two large integers I and J of n bits each normally takes $O(n^2)$ time. Using divide and conquer, this may be reduced. The bit representation of each integer is divided in half, with one half representing **high-order** bits and the other **low-order** bits:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I = I_h2^{n/2} + I_l\\\\\n",
    "J = J_h^2{n/2} + J_l$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, I * J may be computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I * J = I_hJ_h2^n + [(I_h-I_l)*(J_l-J_h)+I_hJ_h+I_lJ_l]2^{n/2}+I_lJ_l$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This yields the recurrence equation (for $n \\geq 2$) of:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T(n) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l}c \\rightarrow \\textrm{ if n < 2 }\\\\ 3T(n/2)+cn \\rightarrow \\textrm{ if } n \\geq 2 \\end{array} \\right.$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, multiplication of two n-bit integers may be accomplished in $O(n^{log_23}) = O(n^{1.585})$ time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matrix Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **Strassen's Algorithm**, the product of two n*n matrices may be found in $O(n^{log7})$ time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Maxima Set Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-objective optimization**: optimization of choices that depend on multiple variables. The following is a simple divide and conquer algorithm for constructing the maxima set of set S containing n points:\n",
    "\n",
    "![maxima-set](./res/11-maxima-set.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm runs in $O(nlogn)$ time"
