    "\n",
    "Priority queues contain the following fundamental methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- insert(k,e): insert element e with key k into queue P\n",
    "- removeMin(): return and remove from P an element with the smallest key, that is an element whose key is less than or equal to that of every other element in P\n",
    "\n",
    "## PQ Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "### PQ Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "The following two phases exist for sorting a collection C of n elements with a priority queue Q:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. put elements of C into an initially empty priority queue P by means of n insert() operations\n",
    "2. extract elements from P in non-decreasing order by means of n removeMin() operations, placing them back into C in order\n",
    "\n",
    "The following algorithm demonstrates PQ sort: \n",
    "\n",
    "![pq-sort](./res/05-pq-sort.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selection Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "The second phase of PQ sort is known as selection sort. It is an in-place algorithm, meaning that it uses a constant amount of memory. It is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![selection-sort](./res/05-selection-sort.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of P is initially n and incrementally decreases with each removeMin() until it becomes 0, meaning that the first removeMin() call takes $O(n)$, the second $O(n-1)$ and so on. Therefore, the total time needed for the sort to take place is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{i=1}^n i = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = O(n^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insertion Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative methodology involves storing items ordered by key values. This means that the first element in S is always the element with the smallest key. This brings the benefit of of an $O(1)$ removeMin() operation (as only the first element of S is being removed), but increases the cost of insert() to $O(n)$, with n being the number of elements in P when the method is executed\n",
    "\n",
    "![insertion-sort](./res/05-insertion-sort.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "The running time of insertion sort is at least $O(n)$ and at most $O(n^2)$, depending on the order of the input sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "## Heaps\n",
    "\n",
    "Heaps are a priority queue implementation that allows for both insertions and removals in logarithmic time. A heap is a binary tree T with the following relational property:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **heap-order property**: in a heap T, for every node v other than the root, the key stored at v is greater than or equal to the key stored at v's parent\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, T must satisfy a structural property:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **complete binary tree**: binary tree T with heigh h is **complete** if the levels 0,1,2,...,h-1 have the maximum number of nodes possible (e.g., level i has $2^i$ nodes for $0 \\leq i \\leq h - 1)$ and in level h-1 all the internal nodes are to the left of the external nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "As T is complete, an important node besides the root is its **last node**, defined to be the right-most, deepest internal node\n",
    "\n",
    "A heap-based priority queue consists of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **heap**: complete binary tree T whose elements are stored at internal nodes and have keys satisfying the heap-order property. For each internal node v of T, the key is denoted as k(v)\n",
    "- **last**: a reference to the last node of T\n",
    "- **comp**: a comparison rule that defines the total order relation among the keys. Assume that comp maintains a minimum element at the root, or else redefine comp accordingly\n",
    "\n",
    "A heap storing n keys has height $h = \\lceil log(n+1) \\rceil$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Array-based Binary Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "For every node v of T, let p(v) be the integer defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- if v is the root of T, then p(v) = 1\n",
    "- if v is the left child of node u, then p(v) = 2p(u)\n",
    "- if v is the right child of node u, then p(v) = 2p(u) + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Array-based Heaps\n",
    "\n",
    "For array-based heaps, the root's key is the array's first element and the index of the last node w is always equal to n, and the first empty external node z has an index equal to n + 1. Z is valid even for the following cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- if current last node w is the right-most node on its level, then z is the left-most node of the bottommost level\n",
    "- if T has no internal nodes, then z is the root of T\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a heap represented by the array [8, 17, 33, 41, 36, 49, 98]:\n",
    "\n",
    "![heap](./res/05-heap.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insertion in a Heap\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to keep T as a complete binary tree, when data is to be inserted into a heap the correct external node z must be identified where expandExternal(z) can be called. Node z is the insertion position\n",
    "\n",
    "After the data has been inserted, the heap-order property must be maintained. k(z) is compared with k(u), the key of z's parent u. If k(u) > k(z), then the key-element pairs z and u are swapped. This swapping, known as **up-heap bubbling**, is continued until there are no violations of the heap-order property\n",
    "\n",
    "### Removal in a Heap\n",
    "\n",
    "The element with the smallest key is stored at the root r of the tree. Instead of deleting r, the key-element pair of the last node w is copied to r, with w being deleted. If both children of r are external roots then this process is done, else, similar to the insertion process, this is followed by **down-heap bubbling**. This has two cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- if the left child of r is internal and the right is external, let s be the left child of r\n",
    "- otherwise let s be a child of r with the smallest key\n",
    "\n",
    "If k(r) is greater than k(s), then the two are swapped\n",
    "\n",
    "Heap operations have the following performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "![heap-performance](./res/05-heap-performance.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Heap Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Heap sort operates in $O(nlogn)$ time\n",
    "\n",
    "If all keys to be stored in the heap are given in advance, then using the **bottom-up** construction method the heap may be built in $O(n)$ time. This is shown in the following algorithm: \n",
    "\n",
    "![bottom-up](./res/05-bottom-up.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extending Priority Queues\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional methods and method families may be used to augment priority queues, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- minElement(): return (but not remove) the element with the smallest key\n",
    "- minKey(): return (but do not remove) the smallest key\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparators \n",
    "\n",
    "A priority queue has one comparator for the entire queue\n",

    "### Locators\n",
    "\n",
    "A locator l is a mechanism for maintaining the association between an element and its current position in a container:\n",
    "\n",
    "- element(): return the element of the item associated with l\n",
    "- key(): return the kew of the item associated with l \n",
