    "# Chapter 02: Basic Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "**Producer-Consumer Model**: one computational process is producing data and another is consuming the produced data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stacks and Queues\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stacks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stack**: data structures that operates under the last-in, first-out principle\n",
    "\n",
    "Supports two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- push(o): insert object o at the top of the stack\n",
    "- pop(): remove from the stack and return its top object\n",
    "\n",
    "Array-based stacks are efficient (both push(o) and pop() operate in O(1) time), but have the limitation of a fixed size. To overcome this, stacks may also be implemented via linked lists\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method stacks** are used to track local memory in the runtime environments of programming languages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Queues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Queue**: data structure that stores items in a first-in, first out order. Elements enter at the rear and are removed from the front\n",
    "\n",
    "Supports two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- enqueue(o): insert object o at the rear of the queue\n",
    "- dequeue(): remove and return from the queue the object at the front \n",
    "\n",
    "Queues are typically tracked via two variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **f**: index to the cell storing the first element\n",
    "- **r**: index to the next available array cell\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "### Index-based Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "**Index-based lists**: linear sequence that supports access to its elements via their indices. A list storing n elements supports the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- get(r): returns the element located at index r\n",
    "- set(r,e): replace the current element at r with e\n",
    "- add(r,e): insert a new element e into the list to have index r\n",
    "  - worst case of $\\theta(n)$ r = 0, as all elements need to be shifted \n",
    "  - best case of $O(n)$ when acting on an item at the end of the list\n",
    "- remove(r): remove the element at index r \n",
    "  - worst case of $\\theta(n)$ r = 0, as all elements need to be shifted \n",
    "  - best case of $O(n)$ when acting on an item at the end of the list\n",
    "  \n",
    "A time-consuming part of index-based lists is shifting the elements to ensure they are continuous after every addition and removal\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linked list**: container of elements that stores each element in a node and keeps references to neighboring nodes in a relative order. Linked lists support the following methods, all of which are $O(1)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "- first(): return the position of the first element\n",
    "- last(): return the position of the last element\n",
    "- before(p): return the position of the element preceding the one at position p\n",
    "- after(p): return the position of the element following the one at position p\n",
    "- insertBefore(p,e): insert element e before position p\n",
    "- insertAfter(p,e): insert element e after position p\n",
    "- remove(p): remove the element at position p \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentinel** nodes (head and tail) don't store data, but allows for easier insertion and deletion of data\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays require $O(N)$ space, where N is the size of the array. A doubly linked list meanwhile requires $O(n)$ space, where n is the number of elements in the sequence. When to use which depends on the situation at hand\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tree**: set of nodes storing elements in a parent-child relationship with the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- tree T has a special node r, called the root, with no parent\n",
    "- each node v of T different from r has a unique parent node u\n",
    "\n",
    "A node is **external** if it has no children (also known as a leaf)\n",
    "\n",
    "Trees support the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- accessor\n",
    "  - root(): return the root of the tree\n",
    "  - parent(v): return the parent of node v\n",
    "  - children(v): return a set containing the children of node v\n",
    "- query\n",
    "  - isInternal(v): test whether node v is internal\n",
    "  - isExternal(v): test whether node v is external\n",
    "  - isRoot(v): test whether node v is the root\n",
    "- generic\n",
    "  - size(): return the number of nodes in the tree\n",
    "  - elements(): return a set containing all the elements stored at nodes of the tree\n",
    "  - positions(): return a set containing all the nodes of the tree\n",
    "  - swapElements(v,w): swap the elements stored at the nodes v and w\n",
    "  - replaceElements(v,e): replace with e and return the element stored at node v\n",
    "\n",
    "**Depth**: number of ancestors of v, excluding v itself. Calculated in $O(n)$ time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Height**: maximum depth of an external node. Calculated in $O(n)$ time when called on the root\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traversal**: systematic way of accessing all nodes of a tree\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preorder Traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "The root of T is visited first and then the sub-trees rooted at its children are recursively traversed. If the tree is ordered, then the sub-trees are traversed according to the order of the children. The following algorithm conducts a preorder traversal:\n",
    "\n",
    "![preorder](./res/02-preorder.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm operates in $O(n)$ time. It yields the following tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "![preorder-tree](./res/02-preorder-tree.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Postorder Traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "This traversal recursively traverses the subtrees rooted at the children of the root first, and then visits the root. Its algorithm is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![postorder](./res/02-postorder.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm operates in $O(n)$ time. It yields the following tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "![postorder-tree](./res/02-postorder-tree.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binary tree**: tree with at most two children per node. A binary tree is **proper** if each internal node has two children\n",
    "\n",
    "Let T be a proper binary tree with n nodes, and let h denote the height of T. Then T has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the number of external nodes in T is at least $h+1$ and is at most $2^h$\n",
    "2. the number of internal nodes in T is at least h and at most $2^h-1$\n",
    "3. the total number of nodes in T is at least $2h+1$ and at most $2^{h+1}-1$\n",
    "4. the height of T is at least $log(n+1)$ and at most $(n-1)/2$, that is, $log(n+1)-1 \\leq h \\leq (n-1)/2$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a proper binary tree T, the number of external nodes is 1 more than the number of internal nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional traversal is possible for binary trees, the **inorder** traversal. This methodology visits nodes \"from left to right\" on the tree\n",
    "\n",
    "![inorder](./res/02-inorder.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "This yields the following tree:\n",
