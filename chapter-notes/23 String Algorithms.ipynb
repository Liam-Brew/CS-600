    "There exist several common operations that are performed on strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Substrings\n",
    "\n",
    "Involve breaking the string down into smaller sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Every string is a substring of itself, but not a proper substring\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a text string T of length n and a pattern string P of length m, find whether P is a substring of T. This notion of a match means that there is a substring of T starting at some index i that matches P, shown by P = T[i...i+m-1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brute-force Pattern Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Enumerate all possible configurations of inputs and pick the best of these options. Very inefficient due to its $O(nm)$ running time\n",
