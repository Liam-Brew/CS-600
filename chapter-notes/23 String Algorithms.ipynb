    "# Chapter 23: String Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "## String Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "There exist several common operations that are performed on strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Substrings\n",
    "\n",
    "Involve breaking the string down into smaller sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Every string is a substring of itself, but not a proper substring\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a text string T of length n and a pattern string P of length m, find whether P is a substring of T. This notion of a match means that there is a substring of T starting at some index i that matches P, shown by P = T[i...i+m-1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brute-force Pattern Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Enumerate all possible configurations of inputs and pick the best of these options. Very inefficient due to its $O(nm)$ running time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Boyer-Moore Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "A pattern matching algorithm that improves running times by using the following two heuristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **looking-glass heuristic**: when testing a possible placement of P against T, begin the comparisons from the end of P and move backward to the front of P\n",
    "- **character-jump heuristic**: during the testing of a possible placement of P against T, a mismatch of text character T[i] = c with the pattern character P[j] is handled as follows:\n",
    "  - if c is not in P: shift P completely past T[i]\n",
    "  - else: shift P until an occurrence of c in P gets aligned with T[i]\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm runs in $O(nm + |\\Sigma|)$ time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-processes the pattern string P so as to compute a **failure function** f that indicates the proper shift of P so that, to the largest extent possible, previously performed comparisons may be re-used\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm runs in $O(n+m)$ time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trie**: tree-based data structure used for storing strings in order to support fast pattern matching and prefix matching\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard Tries\n",
    "\n",
    "Let S be a set of s strings from alphabet $\\Sigma$, such that no string in S is a prefix of another string. A **standard trie** for S is an ordered tree T with the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- each node of T, except the root, is labeled with a character of $\\Sigma$\n",
    "- the ordering of the children of an internal node of T is determined by a canonical ordering of the alphabet $\\Sigma$\n",
    "- T has s external nodes, each associated with a string of S, such that the concatenation of the labels of the nodes on the path from the root to an external node v of T yields the string of S associated with v\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard trie storing a collection S of s strings of total length n from an alphabet of size d has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- every internal node of T has at most d children\n",
    "- T has s external nodes\n",
    "- the height of T is equal to the length of the longest string in S\n",
    "- the number of nodes of T is $O(n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compressed Tries\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to a standard trie but it ensures that each internal node in the trie has at least two children. An internal node v of T is **redundant** if v has one child and is not the root\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suffix Tries\n",
    "\n",
    "A trie when the strings in the collection S are all the suffixes of a string X. Storing all suffixes takes $O(n)$ spaces, with n being the length of X\n",
    "\n",
    "Pattern matching queries on X can be completed in $O(dm)$ time, where d is the alphabet size and m is the length of the pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Suffix tries may be constructed in $O(dn)$ time"
